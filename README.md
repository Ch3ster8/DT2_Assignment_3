# Development Process
   * ### Planning
       * To start I decided to plan, the goal was to come up with a game idea that could be suitably made within a short period of time whilst also including advanced AI and being an engaging experience for the players to allow for testers who are genuinely intrigued by the game.
       * I used a [Trello planning board](https://trello.com/invite/b/671c2038b631c2b34dd67730/ATTI95abe02e27cbc3b28b403a40269ce9310F1771B6/stealth) to organise my idea into basic cards that I could complete step by step, this was to avoid trying to do everything at once and running into an issue that could affect large portions of my game simultaneously. Trello allows me to easily set goals for myself as I can say I want to complete "Movement" and "Map" by the end of the night and upon completion I can drag them to the "Done" tab.
